' State relationships and triggers
note right of CONNECTING : Triggers:\n- TLS handshake\n- Transport parameter exchange\n- Version negotiation
note right of CONNECTED : Triggers:\n- Create streams\n- Send datagrams\n- Process peer streams
note right of H3_READY : Triggers:\n- HEADERS frames\n- DATA frames\n- WebTransport CONNECT
note right of WT_CONNECTED : Triggers:\n- Create WT streams\n- Send WT datagrams\n- Application data

' Cross-layer dependencies
QUICConn --> HTTP3 : CONNECTED enables H3
HTTP3 --> WebTransport : H3_READY enables WT
QUICStream --> HTTP3 : Stream data carries H3 frames
HTTP3 --> WebTransport : CONNECT request/response
